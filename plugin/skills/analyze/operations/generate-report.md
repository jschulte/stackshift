## Notes & Observations

[Any additional observations, concerns, or context that doesn't fit above categories]

Examples:
- Monorepo structure detected but not using workspace tools
- Multiple authentication methods suggest migration in progress
- Infrastructure code is more mature than application code
- Build process is complex and could be simplified
- Dependencies are up-to-date (as of [date])

## Filling Out the Template

### Executive Summary Guidelines

Write a 2-3 paragraph summary answering:
1. What is this application? (Purpose, domain, users)
2. What's the tech stack? (Key technologies)
3. What's the current state? (Completion %, what's done, what's missing)
4. What's next? (Main recommendation)

### Evidence Requirements

For every percentage estimate, provide concrete evidence:
- File counts
- Feature lists
- Specific examples
- Code samples (for TODOs)
- Dates (for documentation)

### Prioritization Logic

Recommend next steps based on:
1. **Critical gaps** - Security, data integrity, deployment blockers
2. **High-value gaps** - User-facing features, core functionality
3. **Quality gaps** - Tests, documentation, error handling
4. **Nice-to-haves** - Polish, optimizations, extras

---

## Report Validation Checklist

Before finalizing the report, verify:

- [ ] All sections filled out (no [TODO] markers left)
- [ ] Percentages are evidence-based, not guesses
- [ ] File paths are accurate and up-to-date
- [ ] Tech stack versions are correct
- [ ] Missing components are clearly identified
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable
- [ ] Executive summary is clear and concise
- [ ] Report is saved to project root as `analysis-report.md`

---

## Sample Output Location

The report should be saved to:
```
/path/to/project-root/analysis-report.md
```

This ensures it's:
- Easy to find
- Version controlled (add to git)
- Referenced by subsequent steps

---

## Next Steps After Report

Once the report is generated and reviewed:

1. **Review with user** - Present key findings
2. **Confirm accuracy** - Ask if the analysis matches their understanding
3. **Adjust estimates** - Update based on user feedback
4. **Proceed to Step 2** - Use the `reverse-engineer` skill to generate comprehensive documentation

The analysis report serves as the foundation for the entire reverse engineering process.
