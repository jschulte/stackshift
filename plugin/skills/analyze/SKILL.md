# Initial Analysis

**Step 1 of 6** in the Reverse Engineering to Spec-Driven Development process.

**Estimated Time:** 5 minutes
**Output:** `analysis-report.md`

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Starting reverse engineering on a new or existing codebase
- Need to understand tech stack and architecture before making changes
- Want to assess project completeness and identify gaps
- First time analyzing this project with the toolkit
- User asks "analyze this codebase" or "what's in this project?"

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Analyze this codebase"
- "What tech stack is this using?"
- "How complete is this application?"
- "Run initial analysis"
- "Start reverse engineering process"

---

## What This Skill Does

This skill performs comprehensive initial analysis by:

1. **Asking which path you want** - Greenfield (new app) or Brownfield (manage existing)
2. **Auto-detecting application context** - Identifies programming languages, frameworks, and build systems
3. **Analyzing directory structure** - Maps architecture patterns and key components
4. **Scanning existing documentation** - Assesses current documentation quality
5. **Estimating completeness** - Evaluates how complete the implementation is
6. **Generating analysis report** - Creates `analysis-report.md` with all findings
7. **Storing path choice** - Saves your selection to guide subsequent steps

---

## Choose Your Path

**FIRST:** Determine which path aligns with your goals.

### Path A: Greenfield (Build New App from Business Logic)

**Use when:**
- Building a new application based on existing app's business logic
- Migrating to a different tech stack
- Want flexibility in implementation choices
- Need platform-agnostic specifications

**Result:**
- Specifications focus on WHAT, not HOW
- Business requirements only
- Can implement in any technology
- Tech-stack agnostic

**Example:** "Extract the business logic from this Rails app so we can rebuild it in Next.js"

### Path B: Brownfield (Manage Existing with Spec Kit)

**Use when:**
- Managing an existing codebase with GitHub Spec Kit
- Want spec-code validation with `/speckit.analyze`
- Planning upgrades or refactoring
- Need specs that match current implementation exactly

**Result:**
- Specifications include both WHAT and HOW
- Business logic + technical implementation
- Tech-stack prescriptive
- `/speckit.analyze` can validate alignment

**Example:** "Add GitHub Spec Kit to this Next.js app so we can manage it with specs going forward"

### Initial Questionnaire

At the start of analysis, you'll answer several questions to configure your journey:

**Question 1: Choose Your Route**
```
Which path best aligns with your goals?

A) Greenfield: Shift to new tech stack
   → Extract business logic only (tech-agnostic)
   → Can implement in any stack

B) Brownfield: Take the wheel on existing code
   → Extract business logic + technical details (prescriptive)
   → Manage existing codebase with specs
```

**Question 2: Choose Your Transmission**
```
How do you want to shift through the gears?

A) Manual - Review each gear before proceeding
   → You're in control
   → Stop at each step
   → Good for first-time users

B) Cruise Control - Shift through all gears automatically
   → Hands-free
   → Unattended execution
   → Good for experienced users or overnight runs
```

**Question 3: Clarifications Strategy** _(If Cruise Control selected)_
```
How should [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers be handled?

A) Defer - Mark them, continue implementation around them
   → Fastest
   → Can clarify later with /speckit.clarify

B) Prompt - Stop and ask questions interactively
   → Most thorough
   → Takes longer

C) Skip - Only implement fully-specified features
   → Safest
   → Some features won't be implemented
```

**Question 4: Implementation Scope** _(If Cruise Control selected)_
```
What should be implemented in Gear 6?

A) None - Stop after specs are ready
   → Just want specifications
   → Will implement manually later

B) P0 only - Critical features only
   → Essential features
   → Fastest implementation

C) P0 + P1 - Critical + high-value features
   → Good balance
   → Most common choice

D) All - Every feature (may take hours/days)
   → Complete implementation
   → Longest runtime
```

**Question 5: Target Stack** _(If Greenfield + Implementation selected)_
```
What tech stack for the new implementation?

Examples:
- Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Prisma + PostgreSQL
- Python/FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL
- Go + Gin + GORM + PostgreSQL
- Your choice: [specify your preferred stack]
```

**Question 6: Project Structure** _(If Greenfield + Implementation selected)_
```
Where should the new application be built?

A) Subfolder (recommended for Web)
   → Default: greenfield/
   → Custom: Specify your own folder name (e.g., v2/, new-app/, rebuilt/)
   → Keeps old and new in same repo
   → Easy comparison and reference

B) Separate repo (requires additional setup)
   → Clean separation
   → Requires creating new repo
   → Needs manual setup in Web

C) Replace in place (destructive)
   → Removes old code as new is built
   → Not recommended (can't compare)
```

**If subfolder chosen, ask for folder name:**
```
What folder name for the new application?

Default: greenfield/
Examples: v2/, new-app/, nextjs-version/, rebuilt/

Your choice: [specify or press enter for greenfield/]
```

All answers are stored in `.stackshift-state.json` and guide the entire workflow.

### Implementing the Questionnaire

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to collect all configuration upfront:

```typescript
// Example implementation
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Which route best aligns with your goals?",
      header: "Route",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {
          label: "Greenfield",
          description: "Shift to new tech stack - extract business logic only (tech-agnostic)"
        },
        {
          label: "Brownfield",
          description: "Manage existing code with specs - extract full implementation (tech-prescriptive)"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "How do you want to shift through the gears?",
      header: "Transmission",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {
          label: "Manual",
          description: "Review each gear before proceeding - you're in control"
        },
        {
          label: "Cruise Control",
          description: "Shift through all gears automatically - hands-free, unattended execution"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
});

// Then based on answers, ask follow-up questions conditionally:
// - If cruise control: Ask clarifications strategy, implementation scope
// - If greenfield + implementing: Ask target stack
// - If greenfield subfolder: Ask folder name (or accept default: greenfield/)
```

**For custom folder name:** Use free-text input or accept default.

**Example:**
```
StackShift: "What folder name for the new application? (default: greenfield/)"

User: "v2/"  (or just press enter for greenfield/)

StackShift: "✅ New app will be built in: v2/"
```

Stored in state as:
```json
{
  "config": {
    "greenfield_location": "v2/"
  }
}
```

## Process Overview

The analysis follows 5 steps:

### Step 1: Auto-Detect Application Context
- Run detection commands for all major languages/frameworks
- Identify the primary technology stack
- Extract version information

See [operations/detect-stack.md](operations/detect-stack.md) for detailed instructions.

### Step 2: Extract Core Metadata
- Application name from manifest or directory
- Version number from package manifests
- Description from README or manifest
- Git repository URL if available
- Technology stack summary

### Step 3: Analyze Directory Structure
- Identify architecture patterns (MVC, microservices, monolith, etc.)
- Find configuration files
- Count source files by type
- Map key components (backend, frontend, database, API, infrastructure)

See [operations/directory-analysis.md](operations/directory-analysis.md) for detailed instructions.

### Step 4: Check for Existing Documentation
- Scan for docs folders and markdown files
- Assess documentation quality
- Identify what's documented vs. what's missing

See [operations/documentation-scan.md](operations/documentation-scan.md) for detailed instructions.

### Step 5: Assess Completeness
- Look for placeholder files (TODO, WIP, etc.)
- Check README for mentions of incomplete features
- Count test files and estimate test coverage
- Verify deployment/CI setup

See [operations/completeness-assessment.md](operations/completeness-assessment.md) for detailed instructions.

---

## Success Criteria

After running this skill, you should have:

- ✅ `analysis-report.md` file created in project root
- ✅ Technology stack clearly identified
- ✅ Directory structure and architecture understood
- ✅ Completeness estimated (% done for backend, frontend, tests, docs)
- ✅ Ready to proceed to Step 2 (Reverse Engineer)

---

## Next Step

Once `analysis-report.md` is created and reviewed, proceed to:

**Step 2: Reverse Engineer** - Use the `reverse-engineer` skill to generate comprehensive documentation.

---

## Principles

For guidance on performing effective initial analysis:
- [principles/multi-language-detection.md](principles/multi-language-detection.md) - Detecting polyglot codebases
- [principles/architecture-pattern-recognition.md](principles/architecture-pattern-recognition.md) - Identifying common patterns

---

## Common Workflows

**New Project Analysis:**
1. User asks to analyze codebase
2. Run all detection commands in parallel
3. Generate analysis report
4. Present summary and ask if ready for Step 2

**Re-analysis:**
1. Check if analysis-report.md already exists
2. Ask user if they want to update it or skip to Step 2
3. If updating, re-run analysis and show diff

**Partial Analysis:**
1. User already knows tech stack
2. Skip detection, focus on completeness assessment
3. Generate abbreviated report

---

## Technical Notes

- **Parallel execution:** Run all language detection commands in parallel for speed
- **Error handling:** Missing manifest files are normal (return empty), don't error
- **File limits:** Use `head` to limit output for large codebases
- **Exclusions:** Always exclude node_modules, vendor, .git, build, dist, target
- **Platform compatibility:** Commands work on macOS, Linux, WSL

---

## Example Invocation

When a user says:

> "I need to reverse engineer this application and create specifications. Let's start."

This skill auto-activates and:
1. Detects tech stack (e.g., Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, AWS)
2. Analyzes directory structure (identifies app/, lib/, prisma/, infrastructure/)
3. Scans documentation (finds README.md, basic setup docs)
4. Assesses completeness (estimates backend 100%, frontend 60%, tests 30%)
5. Generates analysis-report.md
6. Presents summary and recommends proceeding to Step 2

---

**Remember:** This is Step 1 of 6. After analysis, you'll proceed to reverse-engineer, create-specs, gap-analysis, complete-spec, and implement. Each step builds on the previous one.
