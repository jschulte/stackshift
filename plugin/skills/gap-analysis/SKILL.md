# Gap Analysis (with GitHub Spec Kit)

**Step 4 of 6** in the Reverse Engineering to Spec-Driven Development process.

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Step 3 completed (`.specify/` directory exists with specifications)
**Output:** Prioritized gap analysis and implementation roadmap

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- You've completed Step 3 (Create Specifications)
- Have specifications in `.specify/memory/specifications/`
- Ready to identify what's missing or incomplete
- Want to validate specs against actual implementation

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Analyze gaps in implementation"
- "What's missing from the application?"
- "Run speckit analyze"
- "Compare specs to code"

---

## What This Skill Does

Uses **GitHub Spec Kit's `/speckit.analyze`** command plus additional analysis to:

1. **Validate Consistency** - Check specs match implementation
2. **Identify Gaps** - Find PARTIAL and MISSING features
3. **Detect Inconsistencies** - Specs say one thing, code does another
4. **Catalog Technical Debt** - Code quality, tests, documentation needs
5. **Prioritize Implementation** - P0/P1/P2/P3 classification
6. **Create Roadmap** - Phased implementation plan

---

## Process Overview

### Step 1: Run /speckit.analyze

GitHub Spec Kit's built-in validation:

```bash
> /speckit.analyze
```

**What it checks:**
- Specifications marked ✅ COMPLETE but implementation missing
- Implementation exists but not documented in specs
- Inconsistencies between related specifications
- Conflicting requirements across specs
- Outdated implementation status

**Output example:**
```
Analyzing specifications vs implementation...

Issues Found:

1. user-authentication.md marked PARTIAL
   - Spec says: Frontend login UI required
   - Reality: No login components found in codebase

2. analytics-dashboard.md marked MISSING
   - Spec exists but no implementation

3. Inconsistency detected:
   - fish-management.md requires photo-upload feature
   - photo-upload.md marked PARTIAL (upload API missing)

4. Orphaned implementation:
   - src/api/notifications.ts exists
   - No specification found for notifications feature

Summary:
- 3 COMPLETE features
- 4 PARTIAL features
- 5 MISSING features
- 2 inconsistencies
- 1 orphaned implementation
```

See [operations/run-speckit-analyze.md](operations/run-speckit-analyze.md)

### Step 2: Detailed Gap Analysis

Expand on `/speckit.analyze` findings with deeper analysis:

#### A. Review PARTIAL Features

For each ⚠️ PARTIAL feature:
- What exists? (backend, frontend, tests, docs)
- What's missing? (specific components, endpoints, UI)
- Why incomplete? (was it deprioritized? ran out of time?)
- Effort to complete? (hours estimate)
- Blockers? (dependencies, unclear requirements)

#### B. Review MISSING Features

For each ❌ MISSING feature:
- Is it actually needed? (or can it be deprioritized?)
- User impact if missing? (critical, important, nice-to-have)
- Implementation complexity? (simple, moderate, complex)
- Dependencies? (what must be done first)

#### C. Technical Debt Assessment

From `docs/reverse-engineering/technical-debt-analysis.md`:
- Code quality issues
- Missing tests (unit, integration, E2E)
- Documentation gaps
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance bottlenecks

#### D. Identify Clarification Needs

Mark ambiguous areas with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`:
- Unclear requirements
- Missing UX/UI details
- Undefined behavior
- Unspecified constraints

See [operations/detailed-gap-analysis.md](operations/detailed-gap-analysis.md)

### Step 3: Prioritize Implementation

Classify gaps by priority:

**P0 - Critical**
- Blocking major use cases
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data integrity issues
- Broken core functionality

**P1 - High Priority**
- Important for core user value
- High user impact
- Competitive differentiation
- Technical debt causing problems

**P2 - Medium Priority**
- Nice-to-have features
- Improvements to existing features
- Minor technical debt
- Edge cases

**P3 - Low Priority**
- Future enhancements
- Polish and refinements
- Non-critical optimizations

See [operations/prioritization.md](operations/prioritization.md)

### Step 4: Create Implementation Roadmap

Phase the work into manageable chunks:

**Phase 1: P0 Items** (~X hours)
- Complete critical features
- Fix security issues
- Unblock major workflows

**Phase 2: P1 Features** (~X hours)
- Build high-value features
- Address important technical debt
- Improve test coverage

**Phase 3: P2/P3 Enhancements** (~X hours or defer)
- Nice-to-have features
- Polish and refinements
- Optional improvements

## Spec Kit Analysis Results

### Inconsistencies Detected by /speckit.analyze

1. **user-authentication.md** (PARTIAL)
   - Spec: Frontend login UI required
   - Reality: No login components exist
   - Impact: Users cannot authenticate

2. **photo-upload.md → fish-management.md**
   - fish-management depends on photo-upload
   - photo-upload.md is PARTIAL (API incomplete)
   - Impact: Fish photos cannot be uploaded

3. **Orphaned Code: notifications.ts**
   - Implementation exists without specification
   - Action: Create specification or remove code

---

---

## Recommendations

1. **Resolve P0 clarifications first** (Step 5: complete-spec)
2. **Focus on Phase 1** before expanding scope
3. **Use /speckit.implement** for systematic implementation
4. **Update specs as you go** to keep them accurate
5. **Run /speckit.analyze regularly** to catch drift

---

## Next Steps

1. Run complete-spec skill to resolve clarifications
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation
3. Use `/speckit.implement` for each feature
4. Update implementation status in specs
5. Re-run `/speckit.analyze` to validate progress
```

---

## GitHub Spec Kit Integration

After gap analysis, leverage Spec Kit commands:

### Validate Continuously
```bash
# Re-run after making changes
> /speckit.analyze

# Should show fewer issues as you implement
```

### Implement Systematically
```bash
# Generate tasks for a feature
> /speckit.tasks user-authentication

# Implement step-by-step
> /speckit.implement user-authentication

# Updates spec status automatically
```

### Clarify Ambiguities
```bash
# Before implementing unclear features
> /speckit.clarify analytics-dashboard

# Interactive Q&A to fill gaps
```

---

## Success Criteria

After running this skill, you should have:

- ✅ `/speckit.analyze` results reviewed
- ✅ All inconsistencies documented
- ✅ PARTIAL features analyzed (what exists vs missing)
- ✅ MISSING features categorized
- ✅ Technical debt cataloged
- ✅ `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers added
- ✅ Priorities assigned (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- ✅ Phased implementation roadmap
- ✅ `docs/gap-analysis-report.md` created
- ✅ Ready to proceed to Step 5 (Complete Specification)

---

## Next Step

Once gap analysis is complete, proceed to:

**Step 5: Complete Specification** - Use the complete-spec skill to resolve all `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers interactively.

---

## Technical Notes

- `/speckit.analyze` is run first for automated checks
- Manual analysis supplements with deeper insights
- Gap report complements Spec Kit's output
- Keep both `.specify/memory/` specs and gap report updated
- Re-run `/speckit.analyze` frequently to track progress

---

**Remember:** This step combines GitHub Spec Kit's automated validation with manual gap analysis to create a complete picture of what needs to be built.
