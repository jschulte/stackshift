# Greenfield Build Locations

**Where should the new application be built?**

StackShift supports three approaches for greenfield implementations.

---

## Option A: Subfolder (Recommended)

**Build new app as subfolder of current repo**

### Examples

```
my-rails-app/
├── [rails code]           # Original app
├── .specify/              # Tech-agnostic specs
└── greenfield/            # NEW Next.js app
```

Or custom name:
```
my-app/
├── [original]
├── .specify/
└── v2/                    # NEW app
```

### Pros

✅ **Single repo** - Old and new together
✅ **Easy comparison** - Side-by-side
✅ **Works in Web** - Claude Code Web compatible
✅ **Git history** - Both versions tracked
✅ **Gradual migration** - Run both simultaneously

### Cons

❌ **Mixed concerns** - Two apps in one repo
❌ **Larger repo** - Contains both codebases

### Best For

- Gradual migrations
- Side-by-side comparison
- Claude Code Web users
- Learning/experimentation

### Configuration

```json
{
  "config": {
    "greenfield_location": "greenfield/"  // or "v2/", "new-app/", etc.
  }
}
```

---

## Option B: Separate Directory (Local Only)

**Build new app in completely separate location**

### Examples

**Sibling directory:**
```
git/
├── my-app/                    # Original (specs extracted here)
│   └── .specify/
└── my-app-v2/                 # NEW app (built here)
```

**Different location:**
```
~/projects/legacy-app/         # Original
  └── .specify/

~/new-projects/modern-app/     # NEW app
```

### Pros

✅ **Clean separation** - Completely independent
✅ **Independent git** - Separate repos, histories
✅ **Clear boundaries** - No mixing
✅ **Production ready** - Each deployable independently

### Cons

❌ **Doesn't work in Web** - Claude Code Web can't access multiple repos
❌ **Manual repo creation** - Need to create second repo
❌ **Cross-repo references** - Can't easily compare

### Best For

- Production migrations
- Team handoffs (legacy team vs new team)
- Different deployment pipelines
- Long-term separate maintenance

### Configuration

```json
{
  "config": {
    "greenfield_location": "~/git/my-new-app"  // Absolute path
    // or
    "greenfield_location": "../my-app-v2"      // Relative path
  }
}
```

### Setup

**StackShift will:**
1. Create the directory if it doesn't exist
2. Initialize git repo (if not exists)
3. Initialize target stack (npm init, etc.)
4. Build features from specs
5. Commit to the new repo

**You provide:**
- Path to new directory
- StackShift handles the rest!

---

## Option C: Replace in Place (Not Recommended)

**Build new app in same directory, replacing old code**

### How It Works

```
my-app/              # Original Rails app
├── app/
├── config/
└── Gemfile

# StackShift extracts specs first
↓

my-app/              # Specs extracted
├── [rails code]
├── .specify/        # Specs saved
└── docs/

# Then replaces old with new
↓

my-app/              # NEW Next.js app
├── package.json     # New stack
├── app/             # New code (Rails deleted!)
└── .specify/        # Specs remain
```

### Pros

✅ **Same directory** - No reorganization
✅ **Clean result** - Only new code remains

### Cons

❌ **Destructive** - Old code deleted!
❌ **No comparison** - Can't reference old implementation
❌ **Risky** - What if new app has issues?
❌ **Git history lost** - Unless committed first

### Best For

- Prototypes/experiments (don't care about old code)
- When old code is backed up elsewhere
- You're absolutely sure about the rebuild

### Not Recommended Because

- Can't compare old vs new
- Can't fall back if issues
- Loses reference implementation
- Risky for production systems

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | Subfolder | Separate Directory | Replace in Place |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Claude Code Web** | ✅ Works | ❌ No | ✅ Works |
| **Side-by-side** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Clean separation** | ⚠️ Same repo | ✅ Yes | N/A |
| **Risk** | Low | Low | ⚠️ High |
| **Comparison** | ✅ Easy | ⚠️ Manual | ❌ Impossible |
| **Production ready** | ✅ Both apps | ✅ Independent | ✅ One app |
| **Recommended** | ✅ Yes | ✅ For local | ❌ No |

---

## Recommendations

### For Claude Code Web

**Use subfolder:**
```
greenfield_location: "greenfield/"  (or custom name)
```

Web can only work on one repo, so everything must be in same repo.

### For Local Claude Code

**Either works:**

**Subfolder** (easier):
```
greenfield_location: "v2/"
```

**Separate directory** (cleaner):
```
greenfield_location: "~/git/my-new-app"
```

### For Production Migrations

**Start with subfolder, then separate:**

1. **Phase 1:** Build in subfolder
   ```
   my-app/
   ├── [old]
   └── v2/  # New app
   ```

2. **Phase 2:** Test and validate
   - Run both apps
   - Compare behavior
   - Gradually migrate users

3. **Phase 3:** Extract to separate repo
   ```bash
   # Move v2/ to own repo
   mv my-app/v2 ../my-app-v2
   cd ../my-app-v2
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: extracted from v1"
   ```

## Examples in Practice

### Gradual Migration (Subfolder)
```
stripe-clone/
├── legacy/              # Old PHP app
├── .specify/
└── nextjs-version/      # NEW Next.js app
    └── [both running, gradual user migration]
```

### Clean Break (Separate)
```
~/projects/
├── old-monolith/        # Specs extracted
│   └── .specify/
└── new-microservices/   # Built from specs
    ├── auth-service/
    ├── api-service/
    └── web-app/
```

### Quick Iteration (Subfolder)
```
experiment/
├── idea-v1/            # First try
├── idea-v2/            # Second try
├── idea-v3/            # Third try (the one!)
└── .specify/           # Same specs, different implementations
```

**Choose based on your needs!** StackShift supports all approaches. 🚗

**Default:** Subfolder (simplest, works everywhere)
**Power users:** Absolute paths (maximum flexibility)
