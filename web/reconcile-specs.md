# Reconcile & Complete Specifications - StackShift Recovery Prompt

**Purpose**: Fix repositories that went through an earlier version of StackShift and have incomplete spec coverage.

**Use Case**: You have:
- ✅ `docs/reverse-engineering/` with comprehensive documentation (8-10 files)
- ⚠️ Incomplete specs (only gaps, not full features)
- ⚠️ Missing specs for existing functionality
- ❌ Can't use `/speckit.*` commands effectively because specs don't cover the full app

**Goal**: Get COMPLETE spec coverage for the ENTIRE application (existing + missing features), properly formatted for GitHub Spec Kit.

---

## Your Task

You are reconciling incomplete specifications for a repository that has been partially processed by StackShift.

### The Problem

Earlier versions of StackShift created specs ONLY for gaps/missing features, not for existing functionality. This means:
- Existing features aren't under spec control
- Can't use specs to guide future changes
- Specs don't represent the full application
- Implementation phase only builds gaps, ignores existing code

**Your mission**: Create specs for EVERYTHING, not just gaps.

---

## Step 1: Audit Current State

First, understand what you have:

### Check Documentation
```bash
# Verify reverse engineering docs exist
ls docs/reverse-engineering/

# Should contain 9 comprehensive files from StackShift:
# - functional-specification.md (THE COMPLETE APP)
# - integration-points.md (External services, APIs, dependencies - CRITICAL!)
# - configuration-reference.md
# - data-architecture.md
# - operations-guide.md
# - technical-debt-analysis.md
# - observability-requirements.md
# - visual-design-system.md
# - test-documentation.md
```

### Check Existing Specs
```bash
# Check what specs exist
ls specs/ 2>/dev/null || ls .specify/memory/specifications/ 2>/dev/null

# Common issues:
# - Only 2-5 specs (should be 15-30 for a real app)
# - Specs only describe MISSING features
# - No specs for existing functionality
# - Specs not in proper Spec Kit format
```

### Audit Findings

After checking, tell me:
1. **How many reverse-engineering docs exist?** (should be 8-10)
2. **How many specs currently exist?** (probably too few)
3. **What do current specs cover?** (probably just gaps/missing features)
4. **Are existing features documented in specs?** (probably NO - this is the problem!)

---

## Step 2: Read ALL Reverse Engineering Documentation

Read EVERY file in `docs/reverse-engineering/` to understand the COMPLETE application:

### Critical: Read Functional Specification
```bash
cat docs/reverse-engineering/functional-specification.md
```

**This file describes the ENTIRE application** - both what exists AND what's missing.

### Also Read Supporting Docs
- `integration-points.md` - ALL external services, APIs, dependencies (CRITICAL!)
- `data-architecture.md` - All data models
- `configuration-reference.md` - All config and environment variables
- `operations-guide.md` - Deployment and operational details
- `technical-debt-analysis.md` - Implementation status
- `observability-requirements.md` - Monitoring and logging
- `visual-design-system.md` - UI/UX patterns
- `test-documentation.md` - Testing approach

**Goal**: Understand EVERY capability the application has or needs.

---

## Step 3: Extract ALL Features (Existing + Missing)

From the reverse engineering docs, create a COMPLETE feature inventory.

### Feature Categories

**Category A - COMPLETE Features (✅)**:
These are fully implemented and working. Examples:
- User Authentication (login, registration - fully working)
- Product Catalog (listing, search - backend + frontend complete)
- Database Schema (all tables exist and are used)

**Category B - PARTIAL Features (⚠️)**:
These are started but incomplete. Examples:
- Shopping Cart (backend API done, frontend missing)
- User Profile (display works, editing broken)
- Payment Processing (Stripe integrated but no UI)

**Category C - MISSING Features (❌)**:
These are documented but not implemented. Examples:
- Email Notifications (mentioned but no code)
- Admin Dashboard (planned but not started)
- Export to PDF (required but missing)

### IMPORTANT: Create Specs for ALL THREE Categories!

**Do NOT skip COMPLETE features!** Even if something is 100% implemented, it needs a spec so that:
- Future changes are guided by spec
- Testing requirements are documented
- Business rules are captured
- Refactoring preserves behavior

---

## Step 4: Create Comprehensive Specifications

For **EVERY feature** (complete, partial, or missing), create a GitHub Spec Kit specification.

### File Structure

```
specs/
├── 001-user-authentication/
│   ├── spec.md              ← Full spec (even though feature exists!)
│   └── plan.md              ← Only if PARTIAL or MISSING
├── 002-product-catalog/
│   ├── spec.md              ← Full spec (even though complete!)
│   └── plan.md              ← Skip if COMPLETE
├── 003-shopping-cart/
│   ├── spec.md              ← Full spec
│   └── plan.md              ← Yes (partial feature)
├── 004-payment-processing/
│   ├── spec.md              ← Full spec
│   └── plan.md              ← Yes (partial feature)
└── 005-email-notifications/
    ├── spec.md              ← Full spec
    └── plan.md              ← Yes (missing feature)
```

### Spec.md Format (Same for ALL Features)

```markdown
# Feature Specification: {Feature Name}

**Feature Branch**: `{NNN}-{feature-slug}`
**Created**: {date}
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: P0 | P1 | P2

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - {Capability} (Priority: P0/P1/P2)

As a {user type}, I need {capability} so that {benefit}.

**Why this priority**: {Business value}

**Independent Test**: {How to test this}

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** {precondition}, **When** {action}, **Then** {outcome}
2. **Given** {precondition}, **When** {action}, **Then** {outcome}
3. **Given** {precondition}, **When** {action}, **Then** {outcome}

---

{3-6 user stories per feature}

---

### Edge Cases

- {5-10 edge cases}

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST {requirement}
- **FR-002**: System MUST {requirement}
{10-15 functional requirements}

### Key Entities *(if data-related)*

- **{Entity}**: {Description}

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: {Metric}: {Expected value}
{8-12 success criteria}

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: {Response times}
- **Reliability**: {Uptime, error rates}
- **Security**: {Auth, encryption}
- **Maintainability**: {Code quality}

## Implementation Status *(CRITICAL FOR RECONCILIATION)*

### Current State (What EXISTS in codebase)

**Backend**:
- ✅ API endpoint: POST /api/auth/login (implemented in src/auth/login.ts)
- ✅ JWT token generation (implemented)
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt (implemented)
- ❌ Password reset endpoint (missing)

**Frontend**:
- ✅ Login page (src/pages/Login.tsx - complete)
- ❌ Registration page (missing)
- ❌ Password reset UI (missing)

**Tests**:
- ✅ Unit tests for login API (12 tests, 95% coverage)
- ⚠️ Integration tests partial (no error case coverage)
- ❌ E2E tests missing

**Overall Feature Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** (Backend 75%, Frontend 33%, Tests 60%)

### Target State (What SHOULD exist)

{What needs to be built/completed to reach 100%}

### Gap Summary

**Must Build**:
- Backend: Password reset endpoint
- Frontend: Registration page, password reset UI
- Tests: E2E test suite

**Estimated Effort**: {X person-days}

---

## Assumptions

1. {Technical assumptions}
{3-7 assumptions}

## Dependencies

- {Systems, libraries, other features}

## Out of Scope

- {Things NOT in this feature}

## References

- Implementation: `src/auth/` directory
- Tests: `src/__tests__/auth/`
- API Docs: `docs/reverse-engineering/api-documentation.md`
```

### Critical Differences from Old Format

**OLD (Gap-Only) Spec**:
```markdown
# Feature: Email Notifications

Status: ❌ MISSING

What needs to be built:
- Send email on registration
- Send email on password reset
```

**NEW (Complete) Spec**:
```markdown
# Feature Specification: User Authentication

## Implementation Status

### Current State (What EXISTS)
- ✅ Login API complete (src/auth/login.ts)
- ✅ JWT tokens working
- ✅ Login UI complete
- ❌ Registration missing
- ❌ Password reset missing

### Target State (What SHOULD exist)
- All user auth flows complete

### Gap Summary
- Build registration
- Build password reset

Overall: ⚠️ PARTIAL (67% complete)
```

The new format captures BOTH what exists AND what's missing!

---

## Step 5: Handle Existing Specs

If specs already exist, you need to reconcile them:

### Strategy A: Merge Existing Specs (Recommended)

If a spec already exists for a feature:
1. **Read existing spec** - See what it says
2. **Read reverse engineering docs** - See the full picture
3. **Merge information** - Combine both sources
4. **Add Implementation Status section** - Show what exists vs what's missing
5. **Rewrite in proper Spec Kit format** - Use the template above

### Strategy B: Archive and Recreate

If existing specs are too incomplete:
1. **Archive old specs** - Move to `specs-backup/`
2. **Create fresh comprehensive specs** - From reverse engineering docs
3. **Reference old specs** - Pull any useful information

### Strategy C: Keep Complete Specs, Add Missing

If some specs are good:
1. **Keep well-formatted complete specs** - Don't touch what works
2. **Identify missing feature specs** - Compare to reverse engineering docs
3. **Create specs for missing features** - Fill the gaps in spec coverage
4. **Update partial specs** - Add Implementation Status sections

**Recommended**: Use Strategy A (merge) for best results.

---

## Step 6: Verify Complete Coverage

After creating specs, validate coverage:

### Coverage Checklist

Compare `docs/reverse-engineering/functional-specification.md` to `specs/`:

**For EACH capability/feature mentioned in functional spec**:
- [ ] Has a corresponding `specs/###-feature-name/` directory
- [ ] Has a complete `spec.md` file
- [ ] Spec includes Implementation Status section
- [ ] Spec marks what EXISTS (✅) vs what's MISSING (❌)
- [ ] Spec includes user stories, requirements, success criteria
- [ ] Spec follows GitHub Spec Kit format

**For EACH API endpoint in `api-documentation.md`**:
- [ ] Covered by a feature spec
- [ ] Implementation status documented

**For EACH data model in `data-architecture.md`**:
- [ ] Referenced in relevant feature spec
- [ ] Listed in Key Entities section

**For EACH integration in `integration-points.md`**:
- [ ] Has its own spec OR
- [ ] Documented in related feature spec

### Target Metrics

A properly reconciled repository should have:
- **15-50 feature specs** (depending on app size)
- **100% feature coverage** (every capability has a spec)
- **Clear implementation status** (no ambiguity about what exists)
- **Proper Spec Kit format** (can use `/speckit.*` commands)

---

## Step 7: Create Implementation Plans for Incomplete Features

Only for features marked ⚠️ PARTIAL or ❌ MISSING:

### File: `specs/###-feature-name/plan.md`

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: {Feature Name}

## Current State

**What Exists**:
- Backend: {specific files and endpoints}
- Frontend: {specific components}
- Tests: {coverage percentage}

**Evidence**:
- Files: `src/feature/*.ts`
- Tests: `src/__tests__/feature/*.test.ts`

## Target State

**What We Need to Build**:
- Backend: {missing functionality}
- Frontend: {missing UI}
- Tests: {missing coverage}

## Technical Approach

### Backend Changes
1. {Task}
2. {Task}

### Frontend Changes
1. {Task}
2. {Task}

### Testing Strategy
1. {Test plan}

## Estimated Effort

- Backend: {X person-days}
- Frontend: {X person-days}
- Tests: {X person-days}
- **Total**: {X person-days}

## Risks

- {Risk 1 and mitigation}
- {Risk 2 and mitigation}

## Dependencies

- {Other features or systems needed}
```

**IMPORTANT**: Only create `plan.md` for incomplete features. Complete features (✅) don't need implementation plans.

---

## Step 8: Quality Validation

Before completing reconciliation, verify:

### Specification Quality

For EACH spec:
- [ ] Covers a complete, coherent feature
- [ ] Has 3-5 user stories with business value
- [ ] Has 10-15 functional requirements
- [ ] Has 8-12 success criteria
- [ ] Has Implementation Status section showing CURRENT state
- [ ] Properly categorized: ✅ COMPLETE | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ❌ MISSING
- [ ] Follows GitHub Spec Kit template format

### Coverage Quality

Across ALL specs:
- [ ] Every feature mentioned in functional-specification.md is spec'd
- [ ] Every API endpoint has a corresponding spec
- [ ] Every data model is referenced in specs
- [ ] Every integration point is documented
- [ ] No duplicate specs for same feature
- [ ] Numbering is sequential (001, 002, 003...)

### Format Quality

- [ ] All specs in `specs/###-feature-name/` directories
- [ ] All specs named `spec.md`
- [ ] All plans named `plan.md`
- [ ] Constitution exists in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- [ ] Can run `/speckit.analyze` successfully
- [ ] Can run `/speckit.tasks` on any spec

---

## Step 9: Create Reconciliation Summary

After completing reconciliation, create `RECONCILIATION_REPORT.md`:

```markdown
# Spec Reconciliation Report

**Date**: {date}
**Repository**: {name}
**Reverse Engineering Docs**: {count} files, {total KB}

## Before Reconciliation

- **Specs existed**: {count} specs
- **Coverage**: {X}% of application features
- **Status**: {description of what was wrong}
- **Issues**:
  - Only gap/missing features spec'd
  - Existing features not under spec control
  - {other issues}

## After Reconciliation

- **Total Specs Created**: {count} specs
- **Coverage**: 100% of application features
- **Breakdown**:
  - ✅ COMPLETE: {count} features ({X}% of total)
  - ⚠️ PARTIAL: {count} features ({X}% of total)
  - ❌ MISSING: {count} features ({X}% of total)

## Specs Created/Updated

### New Specs (Previously Missing Coverage)
1. **001-user-authentication** (✅ COMPLETE) - Captured existing auth system
2. **002-product-catalog** (✅ COMPLETE) - Documented existing catalog
3. **003-shopping-cart** (⚠️ PARTIAL) - Backend exists, frontend missing
{...list all new specs}

### Updated Specs (Previously Incomplete)
1. **015-payment-processing** - Added Implementation Status section
2. **016-order-management** - Merged with reverse engineering docs
{...list all updated specs}

### Archived Specs (Replaced/Merged)
1. **old-spec-1.md** → Merged into 003-shopping-cart
2. **gap-analysis-only.md** → Replaced with comprehensive specs

## Implementation Status Summary

| Category | Count | Percentage | Effort Remaining |
|----------|-------|-----------|------------------|
| ✅ Complete | {X} | {X}% | 0 person-days |
| ⚠️ Partial | {X} | {X}% | {X} person-days |
| ❌ Missing | {X} | {X}% | {X} person-days |
| **Total** | {X} | 100% | {X} person-days |

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Specs are now complete and comprehensive
2. ✅ All existing functionality is under spec control
3. ✅ Can run `/speckit.analyze` for validation
4. ✅ Can run `/speckit.tasks` for any feature
5. ✅ Ready for spec-driven development workflow

### To Implement Gaps

```bash
# For each PARTIAL or MISSING feature:
cd specs/###-feature-name/
/speckit.tasks          # Generate task list
/speckit.implement      # Build the feature
```

### To Modify Existing Features

Now that existing features have specs:
1. Update the spec first
2. Run `/speckit.tasks` to see what changed
3. Implement the changes
4. Specs now guide changes to existing code!

## Success

This repository is now:
- ✅ Fully spec'd (100% coverage)
- ✅ Existing features documented
- ✅ Missing features identified
- ✅ Ready for spec-driven development
- ✅ Can evolve existing code through spec updates
```

---

## Step 10: Reconciliation Workflow

Here's the step-by-step process I'll follow:

### Phase 1: Discovery (15 minutes)
1. Read `docs/reverse-engineering/functional-specification.md` completely
2. Read `docs/reverse-engineering/technical-debt-analysis.md` for status
3. Read any existing specs to understand what was already done
4. Create comprehensive feature inventory (ALL features)

### Phase 2: Analysis (10 minutes)
1. Categorize each feature: ✅ COMPLETE | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ❌ MISSING
2. Identify features missing spec coverage
3. Identify specs that need updating
4. Plan numbering scheme (001-050+)

### Phase 3: Spec Generation (30-90 minutes)
1. Create specs for COMPLETE features (capture what exists)
2. Create specs for PARTIAL features (document exists + gaps)
3. Create specs for MISSING features (document what's needed)
4. Create `plan.md` for PARTIAL and MISSING features only
5. Create or update `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

### Phase 4: Validation (10 minutes)
1. Verify 100% feature coverage
2. Check all specs follow Spec Kit format
3. Ensure Implementation Status sections are accurate
4. Test that `/speckit.analyze` works
5. Create reconciliation report

### Phase 5: Cleanup (5 minutes)
1. Archive old incomplete specs (if any)
2. Organize specs/ directory
3. Update any README references
4. Commit the reconciled specs

---

## Example: Before vs After

### BEFORE Reconciliation

**docs/reverse-engineering/functional-specification.md** (150KB):
```markdown
# Functional Specification

## Features

1. User Authentication - Login, registration, password reset, JWT tokens
2. Product Catalog - Browse products, search, filter, categories
3. Shopping Cart - Add to cart, update quantities, checkout
4. Payment Processing - Stripe integration, credit cards, receipts
5. Order Management - View orders, track shipping, cancel orders
6. Email Notifications - Registration, password reset, order confirmation
7. Admin Dashboard - User management, product management, analytics
{...25 more features}
```

**specs/** (only 3 files):
```
specs/
├── gap-001-registration.md     ← Only MISSING features spec'd
├── gap-002-admin-dashboard.md  ← Only MISSING features spec'd
└── gap-003-email-notifications.md ← Only MISSING features spec'd
```

**Problem**:
- 30 features in app
- Only 3 specs exist (10% coverage)
- Specs only cover MISSING features
- Existing features (login, catalog, cart, payments, orders) have NO specs!

---

### AFTER Reconciliation

**specs/** (30 comprehensive files):
```
specs/
├── 001-user-authentication/
│   └── spec.md                 ← ✅ COMPLETE (captured existing impl)
├── 002-product-catalog/
│   └── spec.md                 ← ✅ COMPLETE (documented working feature)
├── 003-shopping-cart/
│   ├── spec.md                 ← ⚠️ PARTIAL (backend done, frontend missing)
│   └── plan.md                 ← Implementation plan for frontend
├── 004-payment-processing/
│   ├── spec.md                 ← ⚠️ PARTIAL (Stripe works, UI missing)
│   └── plan.md                 ← Implementation plan for UI
├── 005-order-management/
│   └── spec.md                 ← ✅ COMPLETE (fully working)
├── 006-email-notifications/
│   ├── spec.md                 ← ❌ MISSING (not started)
│   └── plan.md                 ← Implementation plan
├── 007-admin-dashboard/
│   ├── spec.md                 ← ❌ MISSING (not started)
│   └── plan.md                 ← Implementation plan
{...23 more features, each with full spec}
```

**Result**:
- ✅ 30 specs for 30 features (100% coverage!)
- ✅ 18 features marked ✅ COMPLETE (existing functionality now under spec control)
- ✅ 7 features marked ⚠️ PARTIAL (partial implementation documented)
- ✅ 5 features marked ❌ MISSING (gaps identified)
- ✅ Can now use specs to guide changes to existing features!
- ✅ Can implement missing features using `/speckit.implement`

---

## Step 11: Reconciliation Execution

I'm ready to reconcile your repository! Here's what I'll do:

### Phase 1: Audit
1. Read ALL reverse engineering docs
2. List ALL features in the application
3. Check existing specs (if any)
4. Identify spec coverage gaps

**I'll show you the feature inventory and ask for confirmation before proceeding.**

### Phase 2: Generate
1. Create comprehensive specs for EVERY feature
2. Mark implementation status based on codebase evidence
3. Create `plan.md` for incomplete features only
4. Ensure proper GitHub Spec Kit format

### Phase 3: Report
1. Show you what was created
2. Provide reconciliation summary
3. Explain next steps for using the specs

---

## Expected Outcomes

After reconciliation, you'll have:

### Complete Spec Coverage
- ✅ Every feature has a spec (not just gaps!)
- ✅ Existing features documented (under spec control)
- ✅ Missing features identified (ready to build)
- ✅ Partial features detailed (know what to complete)

### Actionable Next Steps
- ✅ Can run `/speckit.analyze` to validate specs
- ✅ Can run `/speckit.tasks` on any feature
- ✅ Can run `/speckit.implement` to build gaps
- ✅ Can UPDATE specs to guide changes to existing code

### Spec-Driven Development Enabled
- ✅ Future changes start with spec updates
- ✅ Existing code evolution is spec-guided
- ✅ Not just "build missing features" but "manage entire app through specs"

---
