# Generate Targeted Epics

Detailed instructions for generating BMAD-format epics written in the target project's personas, domain language, and architecture patterns.

---

## Overview

Takes the mapping object from `map-to-target.md` and the portable extract's epics/component-spec, then generates targeted epics that read as if they were written natively for the target project.

**Input:**
- Portable extract (epics.md + component-spec.md)
- Combined mapping object (personas, domain language, data contracts)
- Target BMAD docs (for additional context)

**Output:**
- `_portable-transplant/targeted-epics.md`
- `_portable-transplant/transplant-report.md`

---

## Step 1: Transform Stories

For each story in the portable extract's epics.md:

### 1a: Replace Personas

Apply persona mapping to all "As a [persona]" clauses:

```
BEFORE: As a [User], I want to calculate my monthly payment
AFTER:  As a Homebuyer, I want to calculate my mortgage payment
```

**Rules:**
- Replace `[User]` with the mapped target persona name
- Replace `[Admin]` with the mapped target admin persona
- Replace `[System]` with the specific mapped system actor
- If one-to-many mapping: generate SEPARATE stories for each target persona
- Adjust story wording to reflect the target persona's perspective

**One-to-many example:**
```
Source: As a [User], I want to search available items

Target (split into two):
  Story 3.1: As a Homebuyer, I want to search property listings
             so that I can find homes within my budget
  Story 3.2: As a Property Investor, I want to search property listings
             so that I can identify investment opportunities
```

### 1b: Translate Domain Language

Apply domain language translations to:
- Story title
- Story description (the "I want" and "so that" clauses)
- Acceptance criteria text
- Any free-text descriptions

```
BEFORE: As a [User], I want to search property listings by type and neighborhood
        so that I can find homes that match my preferences

AFTER:  As a Homebuyer, I want to search property listings by location and type
        so that I can find homes that match my requirements
```

**Rules:**
- Replace all source domain terms with target equivalents
- Adjust sentence structure if translation changes meaning
- Preserve the INTENT of the story (same business value)
- If a term is excluded (no target equivalent), rephrase to omit it
- If a term is flagged for review, mark with `[REVIEW: original term was "X"]`

### 1c: Update Data Contract References

Replace portable data contract references with target model references:

```
BEFORE: Input validated per DC-IN-001 shape
AFTER:  Input validated per DC-IN-001 (mapped to MortgageApplication model)
```

**In acceptance criteria:**
```
BEFORE: - [ ] Result displayed per DC-OUT-001 shape
AFTER:  - [ ] Result displayed per DC-OUT-001 (PaymentEstimate model)
```

### 1d: Preserve Business Rule References

Business rule IDs (BR-*) stay UNCHANGED. They reference the original component-spec.md which contains the precise logic. The targeted epics add target context around the rules:

```
BEFORE: Monthly payment calculated using BR-CALC-001
AFTER:  Monthly mortgage payment calculated using BR-CALC-001
        (formula unchanged; field names mapped per data contract)
```

### 1e: Update Edge Case and Flow References

Edge cases (EC-*) and flows (FLOW-*) keep their IDs but get domain-translated descriptions:

```
BEFORE: Edge Cases: EC-001 (zero down payment)
AFTER:  Edge Cases: EC-001 (zero down payment - minimum 3.5% for FHA loans)
```

---

## Step 2: Transform Epics

### 2a: Rename Epics for Target Domain

Epic names should reflect the target domain:

```
BEFORE: Epic 1: Payment Calculation Engine
AFTER:  Epic 1: Mortgage Payment Calculator

BEFORE: Epic 2: Inventory Search & Discovery
AFTER:  Epic 2: Property Search

BEFORE: Epic 3: Lead Management
AFTER:  Epic 3: Buyer Inquiry Management
```

### 2b: Update Business Goals

Replace source business goals with target equivalents:

```
BEFORE: Business Goal: Help buyers evaluate property budget fit
AFTER:  Business Goal: Enable homebuyers to assess property budget fit
        (aligned with target PRD goal: "Empower buyers with financial clarity")
```

Reference the target PRD's business goals where possible.

### 2c: Re-prioritize if Needed

The portable extract's priorities (P0/P1/P2) were set in the source context. In the target context, priorities may differ:

**Default:** Keep source priorities (they reflect business importance of the logic).

**Override if:** Target PRD has explicit priority guidance that conflicts. Note the change:
```
Priority: P1 (was P0 in source; target PRD priorities authentication over payments)
```

---

## Step 3: Add Target Architecture Context

For each epic, add a brief note about how it fits the target architecture:

```
## Epic 1: Mortgage Payment Calculator

**Priority:** P0
**Business Goal:** Enable homebuyers to assess property budget fit
**Target Architecture Notes:**
- Implements as: React component consuming /api/mortgage/calculate endpoint
- Data layer: MortgageApplication and PaymentEstimate models
- Integration: Mortgage Rate API for live rate data
- Source component: Payment Calculation Engine (ws-payment-calculator)
```

This context comes from reading the target Architecture document.

---

## Step 4: Handle Excluded Content

Some portable extract content may not apply to the target:

### Stories with Excluded Domain Concepts

If a story relies on a domain concept that was excluded in translation:

```
Source story: "As a [User], I want to enter my seller credit value
              to reduce my monthly payment"

Target: seller credit has no equivalent in the target domain

Resolution: EXCLUDE story entirely. Note in transplant report:
  "Story 2.4 excluded: seller credit concept has no target domain equivalent"
```

### Business Rules with Target-Specific Overrides

If a business rule needs target-specific values:

```
BR-VAL-003: Down payment minimum
  Source: 0% minimum (some agencies offer zero-down)
  Target: 3.5% minimum (FHA loan requirement)

Resolution: Note the override in targeted epic:
  "- [ ] Down payment validated per BR-VAL-003
         [TARGET OVERRIDE: minimum 3.5% per FHA requirement, not 0%]"
```

### Data Contracts with Gaps

If the target model has fields not in the source:

```
DC-IN-001 gap: property_type field
  Source didn't have this; target needs it for rate calculations

Resolution: Note the gap in targeted epic:
  "- [ ] Input includes property_type (condo, single-family, multi-unit)
         [NEW: not in source component, required by target architecture]"
```

## Step 5: Generate Cross-Reference Section

At the end of targeted-epics.md, include a cross-reference table:

```markdown
---

## Cross-Reference: Portable Extract -> Target

### Stories
| Target Story | Source Story | Adaptation |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 1.1 Calculate mortgage payment | 1.1 Calculate monthly payment | Domain language only |
| 1.2 Compare rate scenarios | 1.2 Compare payment plans | Domain language only |
| 2.1 Search property listings | 2.1 Search property inventory | Domain + persona |
| 2.4 (excluded) | 2.4 Enter seller credit value | No target equivalent |
| 3.1 Buyer inquiry form | 3.1 Lead submission form | Domain language only |

### Business Rules
| Rule ID | Source Context | Target Context | Adaptation |
|---------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| BR-CALC-001 | Mortgage payment | Investment payment | Field names only |
| BR-VAL-003 | Down payment 0-100% | Down payment 3.5-100% | Target override |
| BR-DEC-001 | Mortgage rate tiers | Investment rate tiers | Thresholds updated |

### Data Contracts
| Contract | Source Model | Target Model | Gaps |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------|
| DC-IN-001 | LoanParameters | MortgageApplication | +property_type |
| DC-OUT-001 | PaymentResult | PaymentEstimate | None |
| DC-STATE-001 | CalculatorState | CalculatorSession | None |
```

---

## Step 6: Quality Checks

### No Source Domain Terms
Scan all targeted epic text for source domain terms:
- No source-specific terms (if source was a real estate brokerage, no "brokerage", etc.)
- No source persona names
- No source service names

**If found:** Apply missed translations.

### No Abstract Personas
Scan for [User], [Admin], [System]:
- All should be replaced with target persona names
- Exception: persona mapping section that documents the mapping

**If found:** Apply persona mapping.

### Business Rule Integrity
Verify that business rules are referenced correctly:
- All BR-* IDs in targeted epics exist in component-spec.md
- No BR-* IDs were lost during translation
- Overrides are clearly marked as `[TARGET OVERRIDE]`

### Story Count Reconciliation
Compare source and target story counts:
```
Source stories: 24
Target stories: 26 (24 translated + 2 split from one-to-many persona mapping)
Excluded: 2 (no target equivalent)
Net: 26 targeted stories from 24 source stories
```

### Completeness Check
Every portable extract epic should be accounted for:
- Translated to target
- Excluded with documented reason
- Flagged for review

No epic or story should silently disappear.
