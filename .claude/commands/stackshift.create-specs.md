description: Gear 3 - Generate GitHub Spec Kit specifications for ALL features
---

Invoke the create-specs skill (Gear 3 of StackShift).

This automatically generates specifications for the ENTIRE application (not just gaps) - creates specs for existing features, partial features, and missing features. Achieves 100% spec coverage.

Prerequisite: Complete Gear 2 (reverse-engineer)

Use the Skill tool with skill="create-specs".
